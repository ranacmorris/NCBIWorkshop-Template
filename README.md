# NCBI Virtual Workshops - Template files

This is a repo to hold the documentation and other supplementary files necessary for a workshop offered by the NCBI Education Team.

Cooper Park (cooper.park@nih.gov) was the original creator of this repo and Rana Morris (rana.morris@nih.gov) is updating it here. 

The "creative" side of this documentation is stored in the \_layouts folder, assets folder, and config.yml file. The actual documentation text is stored in index.md.
